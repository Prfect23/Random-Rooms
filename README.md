# Random-Rooms
The start of a random room generator

I'd like this to be a random dungeon generator. I've started by creating random rectangles in an array. These could be slid over each other to find space as per the usual approach, but Iv'e been distracted by the idea of using voroni cells to connect the rooms together, so I'm just going to upload this as it is.
